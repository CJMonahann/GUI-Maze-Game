This is a Java based GUI maze game project created for the CSC-229 Class at Southern Connecticut State University.

This is not an original work and was derived from professors at other universities within Connecticut. All credit
for this game's design belong to its rightful owners.

RULES:
  Two players compete in a race through a maze of connected rooms to be the first to build a machine. The maze
  consist of ten rooms, some of which have machine parts, tool parts, or no parts at all. The players must 
  collect all machine parts in order, retrieve the needed tools to assemble the machine, and finally
  construct the machine in the workshop.
  
    - Both players start in room 1, starting with player 1, and alternate turns.
    - The machine parts must be collected in order.
    - The tools (located in one room) must be collected before the machine is built.
    - The machine can only be built in the workshop.
    - The game is won by the first player to successfully build the machine in the workshop.
    
 A simple UML Diagram has been provided in JPEG form to better help visualize the various classes and
 components of the game.
